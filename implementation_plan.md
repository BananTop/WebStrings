**Implementation Plan for Interactive String Animation Web Application**

This plan is organized into four phases: Environment Setup, Frontend Development, Integration, and Deployment. Each step is a single action with file paths, commands, and validation tests, referencing the relevant sections of the project documents.

### **Phase 1: Environment Setup**

1.  **Initialize Replit Project & Git**

    *   Action: Create a new Replit project using the Node.js template and initialize a Git repository with two branches: `main` and `dev`.
    *   Location: Project root
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1

2.  **Install Next.js 14 with TypeScript**

    *   Action: Run the following command in the Replit terminal to create a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript:

    npx create-next-app@14 --typescript

    *   Note: We specifically use Next.js 14 per the tech stack requirements.
    *   Location: Project root
    *   Reference: Tech Stack Document

3.  **Add Tailwind CSS and shadcn**

    *   Action: Follow Tailwind CSS and shadcn setup instructions for Next.js by installing necessary packages and configuring Tailwind.
    *   File Paths: Create `/tailwind.config.js` and update `/postcss.config.js` accordingly
    *   Reference: Frontend Guidelines Document

4.  **Ensure Proper Environment Setup**

    *   Action: Run `npm run dev` to verify that the development server starts and Next.js 14 is operating correctly.
    *   Command: npm run dev
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1

### **Phase 2: Frontend Development**

1.  **Setup Application Structure with App Router**

    *   Action: Organize the code using Next.js app router. Create the following directory structure:

        *   `/app/page.tsx` for the main page
        *   `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx` for the animation view
        *   `/app/components/ControlPanel.tsx` for the controls

    *   Reference: PRD Section 1 & Tech Stack Document

2.  **Create Main Page Layout**

    *   Action: In `/app/page.tsx`, design a layout with a full-screen black background and two primary sections: the left side for the animation and the right side for the control panel.
    *   File: `/app/page.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3

3.  **Implement AnimationCanvas Component**

    *   Action: In `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`, create a React component that uses a canvas element to draw vertically hanging white strings.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Sections 1 & 4 (Interactive String Animation)

4.  **Render Default 50 Strings**

    *   Action: Add logic in the AnimationCanvas component to render 50 vertical white strings on the canvas with a fixed x-position.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1 & 4

5.  **Add Mouse-Move Event for Force Field**

    *   Action: Enhance the AnimationCanvas to listen for `mousemove` events, and compute radial displacement and glow intensity based on mouse proximity.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD: Main Animation Interaction

6.  **Implement Physics for Return Animation**

    *   Action: In the AnimationCanvas, integrate logic so that when the mouse leaves, the strings gradually return to their original position at a slower pace than their displacement.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1 (gradual return effect)

7.  **Validation**

    *   Action: Run the app via `npm run dev` in Chrome and verify that the canvas renders 50 white strings on a black background and responds to mouse movement with radial displacement and glowing effects.
    *   Reference: PRD Sections 1 & 6

8.  **Create ControlPanel Component**

    *   Action: In `/app/components/ControlPanel.tsx`, build a modern-styled control panel using shadcn components and Tailwind CSS. Include slider controls for:

        *   Field radius
        *   Field strength
        *   Number of strings
        *   Reset (fallback) velocity

    *   File: `/app/components/ControlPanel.tsx`

    *   Reference: PRD Section 4 & Core Features

9.  **Link Sliders to Local State**

    *   Action: In the ControlPanel component, implement local state management (using React useState or a similar hook) to capture and manipulate slider adjustments.
    *   File: `/app/components/ControlPanel.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 4

10. **Lift State for Shared Controls**

    *   Action: Modify the layout in `/app/page.tsx` to lift the control state so that both AnimationCanvas and ControlPanel receive the animation parameters as props.
    *   File: `/app/page.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3 (real-time updates)

11. **Bind Controls to Animation Parameters**

    *   Action: Update the AnimationCanvas component to use the passed-in props (field radius, field strength, string count, reset speed) to adjust animation behavior in real time.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Sections 3 & 4

12. **Validation**

    *   Action: In the Chrome browser, adjust the sliders in the ControlPanel and verify that changes immediately update the animation on the canvas.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6

### **Phase 3: Integration**

1.  **Integrate Shared State Across Components**

    *   Action: Ensure that the parent component (in `/app/page.tsx`) passes the live control state to both the AnimationCanvas and ControlPanel components.
    *   File: `/app/page.tsx`
    *   Reference: PRD Section 3

2.  **Validate Animation and Control Panel Interconnection**

    *   Action: In the Chrome browser, test that adjusting any slider within the control panel updates the animation instantly and seamlessly.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6

3.  **Integrate Console Logging for Debugging**

    *   Action: Add temporary console logs in both AnimationCanvas and ControlPanel components to log the current animation parameters for monitoring real-time changes.
    *   File: `/app/components/AnimationCanvas.tsx` and `/app/components/ControlPanel.tsx`
    *   Reference: Q&A: Real-Time Feedback

4.  **Validation**

    *   Action: Open the browser’s console to confirm the correct propagation of state changes with every slider modification.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6

### **Phase 4: Deployment**

1.  **Prepare Package.json Deployment Script**

    *   Action: In the `package.json` file, add or verify deployment scripts that are compatible with Replit’s hosting configuration.
    *   File: `/package.json`
    *   Reference: Tech Stack Document

2.  **Push Code to GitHub**

    *   Action: Commit all changes and push the code from the `dev` branch to GitHub, ensuring branch protection for `main` as per project guidelines.
    *   Command: git push origin dev
    *   Reference: PRD Section 1

3.  **Connect Replit to GitHub Repository**

    *   Action: Link the Replit project with the GitHub repository for continuous integration and real-time updates.
    *   Reference: Developer Tools: Replit

4.  **Validation**

    *   Action: After deployment, open the live URL in Chrome and validate that the interactive string animation and control panel work flawlessly with real-time updates.
    *   Reference: PRD Section 6

This completes the implementation plan with step-by-step instructions referencing relevant project documents. Each phase and validation step ensures that the interactive string animation and control panel behave as expected in the Chrome browser environment.
