# Project Requirements Document

## 1. Project Overview

This project is an interactive web application that showcases a dynamic string animation effect. The application features white strings hanging vertically over a stark black background. With a mouse-controlled "force field," the strings react to nearby influence by moving radially while their x-position remains static. The closer a string is to the force field, the brighter it glows and the further it is pushed away. After the influence of the field fades, the strings gradually return to their original positions at a slower speed than their initial displacement.

The primary purpose of building this application is to offer users a visually engaging and interactive experience that blends artistry with physics-based animation. Key objectives include ensuring smooth, real-time animation feedback as the user interacts with the control panel, providing intuitive customization options for the animation properties, and achieving a modern and responsive design primarily for the Chrome browser. Success will be measured by the fluidity and responsiveness of the animation and the clarity and simplicity of the user interface.

## 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope:**

*   Development of a responsive interactive web application using Next.js 14.

*   Creation of a main animation screen that displays vertically hanging white strings over a black background.

*   Implementation of a mouse-controlled "force field" that affects the strings' radial displacement and brightness.

*   A modern-style control panel on the right side featuring sliders for adjusting:

    *   Field radius and strength.
    *   Number of strings (default starts at 50).
    *   Speed at which strings return to their original positions.

*   Real-time responsiveness: adjustments made through the control panel update the animation instantly.

*   Ensuring the application works smoothly in the Chrome browser.

**Out-of-Scope:**

*   User registration, account features, and saving user personalization settings.
*   Touch input control or other non-mouse interaction methods.
*   Integration of any third-party analytics or tracking for user behavior.
*   Any aesthetic or physics-based interaction enhancements beyond what is described for the main animation.

## 3. User Flow

When a new user visits the webpage, they are immediately greeted by a visually striking landing screen showcasing vertically hanging white strings against a uniform black background. The page loads with a default configuration of 50 strings, and the interactive string animation starts automatically. There is no need for registration or login, and the focus is entirely on the immersive visual experience.

Once the animation is up and running, the user can move their mouse freely to create a dynamic "force field." The force field causes the nearby strings to move radially outward, glow brighter, and then slowly return to their original positions once the mouse is moved away. On the right-hand side of the screen, a modern control panel with sliders allows the user to instantly adjust parameters such as the field's radius and strength, the number of strings used, and the reset speed at which the strings fall back into place. All changes provide immediate visual feedback in the animation, ensuring a continuous and engaging interaction.

## 4. Core Features (Bullet Points)

*   **Interactive String Animation:**

    *   Display of white strings hanging vertically against a black background.
    *   Real-time reaction to a mouse-controlled force field that pushes strings radially.
    *   Strings glow brighter when closer to the force field.

*   **Dynamic Control Panel:**

    *   Sliders for adjusting:

        *   Field radius.
        *   Field strength.
        *   Number of strings (default is 50).
        *   Fall-back velocity (reset speed of strings).

    *   Immediate, real-time updates to the animation as sliders are adjusted.

*   **Smooth, Physics-Inspired Movement:**

    *   Fixed x-position for strings while allowing smooth radial displacement.
    *   Gradual return of strings to the default state at a slower, more natural pace after the force field is removed.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 using the app router for dynamic UI.

*   **Programming Language:** TypeScript for robust type checking.

*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS to quickly style the components; shadcn for a component-based approach.

*   **AI/Assistance Tools:**

    *   Cursor for AI-powered coding assistance.
    *   GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet for code suggestion, error-checking, and overall intelligent code support.

*   **Development Environment:** Replit for real-time updates and collaborative development.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:**

    *   The interactive animation must provide real-time feedback without noticeable lag.
    *   Ensure fast updates when adjusting control panel sliders, especially in the Chrome browser environment.

*   **Security & Compliance:**

    *   Basic web security practices must be followed, although no extensive data handling is in scope for now.

*   **Usability & Accessibility:**

    *   A modern, intuitive UI with a simple layout focused primarily on the visual animation and control panel.
    *   The application must be responsive vertically and horizontally on Chrome.

*   **Maintainability:**

    *   Code should be modular, using modern frameworks and practices to ensure future enhancements are easily integrated.

## 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The project targets the Chrome browser specifically, so compatibility with other browsers is not a primary concern.
*   It is assumed that users will be interacting with the application using a mouse; there is no requirement to support touch input.
*   The initial version is focused solely on the string animation and control functionality. User registration or extensive backend features for data persistence are not in scope.
*   The AI coding assistants (Cursor, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and the development environment on Replit are assumed to be available and operational for coding support and real-time testing.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Performance Bottlenecks:**

    *   Ensuring smooth real-time animations when multiple parameters are adjusted simultaneously might be challenging. Careful performance profiling and testing in Chrome are essential.

*   **Real-Time Feedback Delays:**

    *   The system must handle immediate updates from the control panel without lag. Developers should consider debouncing strategies for slider inputs if needed.

*   **Browser-Specific Functionality:**

    *   The application is optimized for Chrome; ensuring compatibility and consistent performance might be a challenge if any additional browser support is required later.

*   **Physics Simulation Complexity:**

    *   The physics behind the string movements, including the radial displacement and slowing return speed, may require fine-tuning to achieve a natural look. Iterative testing with user feedback can help mitigate this risk.

*   **Integration of AI Tools:**

    *   While using AI tools like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet can speed up development, reliance on these tools may occasionally introduce ambiguities or errors that require additional manual oversight.
