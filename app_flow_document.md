# App Flow Document

## Introduction

This interactive web application provides a dynamic string animation that transforms a visually striking interface into an engaging playground. The main objective is to allow users to interact with vertically hanging white strings over a solid black background by using a mouse-controlled force field. When the user moves the mouse, the strings respond by moving radially and glowing brighter the closer they are to the force field, only to gradually ease back to their starting positions once the field is removed. The application is designed to work smoothly in the Chrome browser, catering to users looking for a modern and immersive visual experience, with an additional control panel that allows immediate adjustments to key animation parameters such as field radius, field strength, number of strings, and reset speed.

## Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

When a user first accesses the application, there is no need for registration, sign-in, or sign-up. The user is immediately presented with the landing page which is fully loaded with the interactive string animation running on a black background. Since account-related functionality is not in scope for this build, users have a straightforward entry point that focuses solely on experiencing the animation without the distraction of authentication flows.

## Main Dashboard or Home Page

After arriving at the application, the primary view is the main animation screen. This home page is visually dominated by the stark contrast of white strings suspended vertically against a dark backdrop. Centrally featured is the interactive area where the strings react in real time to mouse movements. Alongside this canvas, a modern control panel is seamlessly integrated on the right-hand side. The user sees a series of sliders that control key animation properties such as field radius, field strength, the number of strings, and how quickly the strings revert to their original positions. The layout is intuitive where the main animation occupies the majority of the space while the control panel acts as an adjustment tool that updates the animation instantly. Navigation within the application is minimal, with the home page serving both as the starting point and the continuous space for interaction.

## Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

The experience begins as soon as the landing page is loaded, where the default state of fifty strings is animated automatically. Users immediately perceive the dynamic environment where the strings hang vertically. Upon moving the mouse, the application detects this input and creates a virtual force field that influences the strings. Even though the x-position of the strings does not change, they are pushed radially outward, and their brightness increases the closer they are to the force field. As the mouse moves, the animation updates continuously, ensuring that the response feels fluid and natural. The control panel on the right allows users to adjust different parameters. When a slider is moved, a corresponding attribute in the real-time animation is updated instantly. For instance, adjusting the field’s radius or strength immediately modifies the extent and intensity of the string movement. Changing the number of strings or the reset speed alters the composition and behaviour of the animation, all without interrupting the ongoing real-time feedback. There is a clear page transition within this single-page application where all interactions are kept on the same screen, ensuring a constant immersive experience with seamless adjustments and visual feedback. Future enhancements might include additional settings or advanced physics-based options, and these would be accessible in the same centralized environment.

## Settings and Account Management

Since the current build does not include user or account-specific settings, there is no traditional settings or account management page. However, users are provided with an adjustable control panel designed to alter animation attributes on the fly. This panel is intuitive and does not require any form of persistent storage as it operates in a session-based manner; all adjustments are temporary and reflected immediately in the animation. If future enhancements add user personalization or account settings, this area could expand to include a dedicated settings page or modal where users can configure their preferences, billing information, or other account-related details. As it stands, the control panel serves as the de facto settings environment, and returning to the animation is as simple as continuing to interact within the same screen.

## Error States and Alternate Paths

The application is designed to provide a smooth experience while maintaining clear feedback for any unexpected user actions or errors. In cases where the system fails to apply the adjustments—perhaps due to an invalid slider value or a temporary loss of connectivity—the application displays a simple and clear error message on the screen. These messages are subtle and designed to not disturb the overall immersive experience, ensuring that cues are given without disorienting the user. If an error occurs while a user is interacting with the control panel, the system gracefully falls back to the prior valid state of the animation, helping the user to quickly regain a normal experience. Navigation remains on the same page, and users are encouraged to try their adjustments again. Since there are no multiple pages for sign-in or advanced settings in this build, the error management approach is focused solely on the elements within the interactive animation and control panel.

## Conclusion and Overall App Journey

The entire journey within this application begins with a visually captivating landing view where users immediately encounter interactive string animations. Bypassing traditional user authentication, the experience is designed to instantly engage the viewer in a modern art-like presentation powered by realistic physics simulations. As users navigate the application, they use their mouse to create a dynamic force field, watching as the strings react by moving radially and glowing brighter, only to return gracefully to their original positions. The control panel on the right serves as the primary mechanism for customization, ensuring real-time feedback and fluid interactions throughout the session. Overall, the application delivers a clear, unified user experience that combines aesthetic design with seamless interactive adjustments, setting the stage for potential future enhancements without ever compromising the simplicity and immediacy of the current visual journey.
